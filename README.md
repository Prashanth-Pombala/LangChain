*Makes as API call to OPENAI to get a good name for a restaurant given the type of cusine( uses Prompt templates).
*Uses sequencing to generate a possible menu for the name of the restaurant 
*Uses streamlit to generate a page to allow the user select the cusine for which a name and menu should be generated.
